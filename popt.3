.SH DESCRIPTION
The popt library exists essentially for parsing command-line 
options. It is found superior in many ways when compared to 
parsing the argv array by hand or using the getopt functions 
.B getopt()
and 
.B getopt_long()
[see 
.BR getopt "(3)]."  
Some specific advantages of popt are: it does not utilize global 
.RI "variables, thus enabling multiple passes in parsing " argv
.RI "; it can parse an arbitrary array of " argv "-style elements, "
allowing parsing of command-line-strings from any source; and 
finally, it provides a standard method of option aliasing (to be 
discussed at length below.)
.sp
Like
.BR getopt_long() ,
the popt library supports short and long style options.  Recall 
that a 
.B short option
consists of a - character followed by a single alphanumeric character.
A 
.BR "long option" ,
common in GNU utilities, consists of two - characters followed by a
string made up of letters, numbers and hyphens.  Either type of option
may be followed by an argument.  A space separates a short option from
its arguments; either a space or an = separates a long option from an
argument. 
.sp
The popt library is highly portable and should work on any POSIX 
platform.  The latest version is always available from: 
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/code/popt.
.sp
It may be redistributed under either the GNU General Public License 
or the GNU Library General Public License, at the distributor's discretion.
.SH "BASIC POPT USAGE"
.SS "1. THE OPTION TABLE"
Applications provide popt with information on their command-line 
options by means of an "option table," i.e., an array of 
.B struct poptOption 
structures:
.sp
#include <popt.h>
.sp
.nf
struct poptOption {
     const char * longName;  /* may be NULL */
     char shortName;   /* may be '\\0' */
     int argInfo;
     void * arg;   /* depends on argInfo */
     int val;  /* 0 means don't return, just update flag */
};
.fi
.sp
Each member of the table defines a single option that may be 
passed to the program.  Long and short options are considered 
a single option that may occur in two different forms.  The 
first two members, 
.IR longName " and " shortName ", define the names of the option;"
the first is a long name, while the latter is a single character.
.sp
The 
.IR argInfo " member tell popt what type of argument is expected" 
after the argument.  If no option is expected,
.BR POPT_ARG_NONE " should be used.  (Connoisseurs of " getopt() 
.RI "will note that " argInfo " is the only field of "
.BR "struct poptOption" " that is not directly analogous to a field in "
.RB "the " getopt_long() " argument table.  The similarity between the "
.RB "two allows for easy transitions from " getopt_long " to popt.) " 
The rest of the valid values are shown in the following table:
.sp
.nf
.B  "   Value            Description                arg Type"
.BR POPT_ARG_NONE "   No argument expected             int"
.BR POPT_ARG_STRING " No type checking to be performed char *"
.BR POPT_ARG_INT "    An integer argument is expected  int"
.BR POPT_ARG_LONG "   A long integer is expected       long"
.sp
.fi
.RI "The next element, " arg ", allows popt to automatically update "
.RI "program variables when the option is used. If " arg " is " 
.BR NULL ", it is ignored and popt takes no special action. " 
Otherwise it should point to a variable of the type indicated in the 
right-most column of the table above.
.sp
.RI "If the option takes no argument (" argInfo " is " 
.BR POPT_ARG_NONE "), the variable pointed to by " 
.IR arg " is set to 1 when the option is used.  (Incidentally, it "
will perhaps not escape the attention of hunt-and-peck typists that 
.RB "the value of " POPT_ARG_NONE " is 0.)  If the option does take "
an argument, the variable that 
.IR arg " points to is updated to reflect the value of the argument." 
.RB "Any string is acceptable for " POPT_ARG_STRING " arguments, but "
.BR POPT_ARG_INT " and " POPT_ARG_LONG " are converted to the 
appropriate type, and an error returned if the conversion fails.
.sp
.RI "The final option, " val ", is the value popt's parsing function 
should return when the option is encountered.  If it is 0, the parsing
function does not return a value, instead parsing the next 
command-line argument.
.sp
The final structure in the table should have all the pointer values set
.RB "to " NULL " and all the arithmetic values set to 0, marking the "
end of the table.
.SS "2. CREATING A CONTEXT"
popt can interleave the parsing of multiple command-line sets. It allows
this by keeping all the state information for a particular set of
command-line arguments in a 
.BR poptContext " data structure, an opaque type that should not be "
modified outside the popt library.
.sp
.RB "New popt contexts are created by " poptGetContext() ":"
.sp
.nf
.BI "poptContext poptGetContext(char * " name ", int "argc ",
.BI "                           char ** "argv ",
.BI "                           struct poptOption * "options ",
.BI "                           int "flags ");"
.fi
.sp
The first parameter, 
.IR name ", is used only for alias handling (discussed later). It "
should be the name of the application whose options are being parsed,
.RB "or should be " NULL " if no option aliasing is desired. The next "
two arguments specify the command-line arguments to parse. These are 
.RB "generally passed to " poptGetContext() " exactly as they were "
.RB "passed to the program's " main() " function. The " 
.IR options " parameter points to the table of command-line options, "
which was described in the previous section. The final parameter, 
.IR flags ",is not currently used but should always be specified as 
0 for compatibility with future versions of the popt library.
.sp
.RB "A " poptContext " keeps track of which options have already been "
parsed and which remain, among other things. If a program wishes to 
restart option processing of a set of arguments, it can reset the 
.BR poptContext " by passing the context as the sole argument to "
.BR poptResetContext() .
.sp
When argument processing is complete, the process should free the 
.BR poptContext " as it contains dynamically allocated components. The "
.BR poptFreeContext() " function takes a " 
.BR poptContext " as its sole argument and frees the resources the "
context is using.
.sp
.RB "Here are the prototypes of both " poptResetContext() " and "
.BR poptFreeContext() :
.sp
.nf
.B #include <popt.h>
.BI "void poptFreeContext(poptContext " con ");"
.BI "void poptResetContext(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
.sp
.SS "3. PARSING THE COMMAND LINE"
.RB "After an application has created a " poptContext ", it may begin "
.RB "parsing arguments. " poptGetNextOpt() " performs the actual "
argument parsing.
.sp
.nf
.B #include <popt.h>
.BI "int poptGetNextOpt(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
.sp
Taking the context as its sole argument, this function parses the next
command-line argument found. After finding the next argument in the
option table, the function fills in the object pointed to by the option 
.RI "table entry's " arg 
.RB "pointer if it is not " NULL ". If the val entry for the option is "
non-0, the function then returns that value. Otherwise, 
.BR poptGetNextOpt() " continues on to the next argument."
.sp
.BR poptGetNextOpt() " returns -1 when the final argument has been "
parsed, and other negative values when errors occur. This makes it a 
good idea to 
.RI "keep the " val " elements in the options table greater than 0."
.sp
.RI "If all of the command-line options are handled through " arg 
pointers, command-line parsing is reduced to the following line of code:
.sp
.nf
rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon);
.fi
.sp
Many applications require more complex command-line parsing than this,
however, and use the following structure:
.sp
.nf
while ((rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon)) > 0) {
     switch (rc) {
          /* specific arguments are handled here */
     }
}
.fi
.sp
When returned options are handled, the application needs to know the
value of any arguments that were specified after the option. There are two
ways to discover them. One is to ask popt to fill in a variable with the 
.RI "value of the option through the option table's " arg " elements. The "
.RB "other is to use " poptGetOptArg() ":"
.sp
.nf
.B #include <popt.h>
.BI "char * poptGetOptArg(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
.sp
This function returns the argument given for the final option returned by
.BR poptGetNextOpt() ", or it returns " NULL " if no argument was specified."
.sp
.SS "4. LEFTOVER ARGUMENTS"
Many applications take an arbitrary number of command-line arguments,
such as a list of file names. When popt encounters an argument that does
not begin with a -, it assumes it is such an argument and adds it to a list
of leftover arguments. Three functions allow applications to access such
arguments:
.nf
.HP
.BI "char * poptGetArg(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
This function returns the next leftover argument and marks it as
processed.
.PP
.nf
.HP
.BI "char * poptPeekArg(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
The next leftover argument is returned but not marked as processed.
This allows an application to look ahead into the argument list,
without modifying the list.
.PP
.nf
.HP
.BI "char ** poptGetArgs(poptContext " con ");"
.fi
All the leftover arguments are returned in a manner identical to 
.IR argv ".  The final element in the returned array points to "
.BR NULL ", indicating the end of the arguments.
.PP 
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
All of the popt functions that can return errors return integers. 
When an error occurs, a negative error code is returned. The 
following table summarizes the error codes that occur:
.sp
.nf
.B "     Error                      Description"
.BR "POPT_ERROR_NOARG       " "Argument missing for an option."
.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADOPT      " "Option's argument couldn't be parsed."
.BR "POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP " "Option aliasing nested too deeply."
.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE    " "Quotations do not match."
.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER   " "Option couldn't be converted to number."
.BR "POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW    " "A given number was too big or small."
.fi
.sp
Here is a more detailed discussion of each error:
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_NOARG
An option that requires an argument was specified on the command
line, but no argument was given. This can be returned only by
.BR poptGetNextOpt() .
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_BADOPT
.RI "An option was specified in " argv " but is not in the option 
.RB "table. This error can be returned only from " poptGetNextOpt() .
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP
A set of option aliases is nested too deeply. Currently, popt 
follows options only 10 levels to prevent infinite recursion. Only 
.BR poptGetNextOpt() " can return this error."
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE
A parsed string has a quotation mismatch (such as a single quotation
.RB "mark). " poptParseArgvString() ", " poptReadConfigFile() ", or "
.BR poptReadDefaultConfig() " can return this error."
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER
A conversion from a string to a number (int or long) failed due
to the string containing nonnumeric characters. This occurs when
.BR poptGetNextOpt() " is processing an argument of type " 
.BR POPT_ARG_INT " or " POPT_ARG_LONG .
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW
A string-to-number conversion failed because the number was too
.RB "large or too small. Like " POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER ", this error 
.RB "can occur only when " poptGetNextOpt() " is processing an "
.RB "argument of type " POPT_ARG_INT " or " POPT_ARG_LONG .  
.sp
.TP
.B POPT_ERROR_ERRNO
.RI "A system call returned with an error, and " errno " still 
contains the error from the system call. Both 
.BR poptReadConfigFile() " and " poptReadDefaultConfig() " can "
return this error.
.sp
.PP
Two functions are available to make it easy for applications to provide
good error messages.
.HP
.nf
.BI "const char * poptStrerror(const int " error ");"
.fi
This function takes a popt error code and returns a string describing
.RB "the error, just as with the standard " strerror() " function."
.PP
.HP
.nf
.BI "char * poptBadOption(poptContext " con ", int " flags ");"
.fi
.RB "If an error occurred during " poptGetNextOpt() ", this function "
.RI "returns the option that caused the error. If the " flags " argument"
.RB "is set to " POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS ", the outermost option is "
.RI "returned. Otherwise, " flags " should be 0, and the option that is "
returned may have been specified through an alias.
.PP
These two functions make popt error handling trivial for most 
applications. When an error is detected from most of the functions, 
an error message is printed along with the error string from 
.BR poptStrerror() ". When an error occurs during argument parsing, "
code similiar to the following displays a useful error message:
.sp
.nf
fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\\n",
        poptBadOption(optCon, POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS),
        poptStrerror(rc));
.fi
.sp
.SH "OPTION ALIASING"
.RB "One of the primary benefits of using popt over " getopt() " is the "
ability to use option aliasing. This lets the user specify options that 
popt expands into other options when they are specified. If the standard 
.RB "grep program made use of popt, users could add a " --text " option "
.RB "that expanded to " "-i -n -E -2" " to let them more easily find "
information in text files.
.sp
.SS "1. SPECIFYING ALIASES"
.RI "Aliases are normally specified in two places: " /etc/popt 
.RB "and the " .popt " file in the user's home directory (found through "
.RB "the " HOME " environment variable). Both files have the same format, "
an arbitrary number of lines formatted like this:
.sp
.IB appname " alias " newoption "" " expansion"
.sp
.RI "The " appname " is the name of the application, which must be the "
.RI "same as the " name " parameter passed to "
.BR poptGetContext() ". This allows each file to specify aliases for "
.RB "multiple programs. The " alias " keyword specifies that an alias is "
being defined; currently popt configuration files support only aliases, but
other abilities may be added in the future. The next option is the option
that should be aliased, and it may be either a short or a long option. The
rest of the line specifies the expansion for the alias. It is parsed 
similarly to a shell command, which allows \\, ", and ' to be used for 
quoting. If a backslash is the final character on a line, the next line 
in the file is assumed to be a logical continuation of the line containing 
the backslash, just as in shell.
.sp
.RB "The following entry would add a " --text " option to the grep command, "
as suggested at the beginning of this section.
.sp
.B "grep alias --text -i -n -E -2"
.SS "2. ENABLING ALIASES"
.RB "An application must enable alias expansion for a " poptContext 
.RB "before calling " poptGetNextArg() " for the first time. There are "
three functions that define aliases for a context:
.HP
.nf
.BI "int poptReadDefaultConfig(poptContext " con ", int " flags ");"
.fi
.RI "This function reads aliases from " /etc/popt " and the "
.BR .popt " file in the user's home directory. Currently, "
.IR flags " should be "
.BR NULL ", as it is provided only for future expansion."
.PP
.HP
.nf
.BI "int poptReadConfigFile(poptContext " con ", char * " fn ");"
.fi
.RI "The file specified by " fn " is opened and parsed as a popt "
configuration file. This allows programs to use program-specific 
configuration files.
.PP
.HP
.nf
.BI "int poptAddAlias(poptContext " con ", struct poptAlias " alias ",
.BI "                 int " flags ");"
.fi
Occasionally, processes want to specify aliases without having to
read them from a configuration file. This function adds a new alias
.RI "to a context. The " flags " argument should be 0, as it is "
currently reserved for future expansion. The new alias is specified 
.RB "as a " "struct poptAlias" ", which is defined as:"
.sp
.nf
struct poptAlias {
     char * longName; /* may be NULL */
     char shortName; /* may be '\\0' */
     int argc;
     char ** argv; /* must be free()able */
};
.fi
.sp
.RI "The first two elements, " longName " and " shortName ", specify "
.RI "the option that is aliased. The final two, " argc " and " argv ","
define the expansion to use when the aliases option is encountered.
.PP
.SH "PARSING ARGUMENT STRINGS"
Although popt is usually used for parsing arguments already divided into
.RI "an " argv "-style array, some programs need to parse strings that "
are formatted identically to command lines. To facilitate this, popt 
provides a function that parses a string into an array of strings, 
using rules similiar to normal shell parsing.
.sp
.nf
.B "#include <popt.h>"
.BI "int poptParseArgvString(char * " s ", int *  "argcPtr ",
.BI "                        char *** " argvPtr ");"
.fi
.sp
.RI "The string s is parsed into an " argv "-style array. The integer "
.RI "pointed to by the second parameter, " argcPtr ", contains the number "
of elements parsed, and the pointer pointed to by the final parameter is 
set to point to the newly created array. The array is dynamically 
.RB "allocated and should be " free() "ed when the application is finished "
with it.
.sp
.RI "The " argvPtr 
.RB "created by " poptParseArgvString() " is suitable to pass directly "
.RB "to " poptGetContext() .
.SH "HANDLING EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
Some applications implement the equivalent of option aliasing but need
.RB "to do so through special logic. The " poptStuffArgs() " function "
allows an application to insert new arguments into the current 
.BR poptContext .
.sp
.nf
.B "#include <popt.h>"
.BI "int poptStuffArgs(poptContext "con ", char ** " argv ");"
.fi
.sp
.RI "The passed " argv 
.RB "must have a " NULL " pointer as its final element. When "
.BR poptGetNextOpt() " is next called, the "
"stuffed" arguments are the first to be parsed. popt returns to the 
normal arguments once all the stuffed arguments have been exhausted.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following example is a simplified version of the program "robin" 
which appears in Chapter 15 of the text cited below.  Robin has 
been stripped of everything but its argument-parsing logic, slightly 
reworked, and renamed "parse." It may prove useful in illustrating 
at least some of the features of the extremely rich popt library.

RPM, a popular Linux package management program, makes heavy use
of popt's features. Many of its command-line arguments are implemented
through popt aliases, which makes RPM an excellent example of how to
take advantage of the popt library. For more information on RPM, see
